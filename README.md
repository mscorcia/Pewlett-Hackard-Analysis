## Summary:

Noticing that the majority of the workforce, who have senior titles at Pewlett-Hackard, are either ready for retirment or mentorship eligible, confirms that there will be many positions to fill at higher levels.  There may not be enough people to fill these jobs with the amount of experience required to be successful.  In order to combat this, it is best that the company try to learn what made these employees so successful, which could lead to the development of better training plans and a more efficient onboarding process.
